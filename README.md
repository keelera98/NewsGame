### Game Name: What Spill?
  Oil spills are detrimental to ocean environment, and sadly, according to the U.S. Department of energy, 1.3 million gallons of oil is spilled every year. Yet, we don't hear about it in the news. The only time oil spills are reported is if they are major ones, like the Deepwater Horizon event in the Gulf of Mexico. Every time an oil spill happens it is detrimental to ocean life. There needs to be a change when it comes to extracting oil from the ocean or a switch to cleaner energy.

  My game will cover the topic of oil spills in the ocean. The user will take on the role of a major company like BP. They will move their oil tanker to different spots marked on the ocean where oil can be found. As they start the extraction process they will spill oil. They can choose to stop extracting oil from that spot and go somewhere else or they can keep going until they have all the oil. The longer they stay the more oil will leak, but they will recieve more money. If they go to a different spot they will won't earn as much money, but they didn't leak as much oil. The objective is to make as much money as possible in the time limit.
  
  This game shows us what greed does to our environment. The user can try their hardest to not leak a lot of oil, but they they will lose out on profit. And in the end oil always ends up leaking. So, the user really only has one choice, which is to keep drilling no matter the cost to the enviroment. Most oil companies have the same mentality, and it hurts all of us in the long run.
